# About Git
Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to your code and collaborate with others. As a web developer, you will be using Git extensively. Here are some basic Git commands that you should know:

git add: Add changes to the staging area. (Command: git add .)

git commit: Save changes to the local repository with a commit message. (Command: git commit -m "Your comment about the commit")

git push: Send changes to the remote repository. (Command: git push [options] < repository-name > < branch-name >

Make sure to use meaningful commit messages that describe the changes you've made. Also, pull changes from the remote repository before pushing your changes to avoid conflicts.
